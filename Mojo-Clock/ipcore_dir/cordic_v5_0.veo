*     The Xilinx CORDIC LogiCORE is a module for generation of the             *
*     generalized coordinate rotational digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm    *
*     which iteratively solves trigonometric, hyperbolic and square root       *
*     equations. The core is fully synchronous using a single clock and has    *
*     AXI4 Stream compliant interfaces. Options include parameterizable        *
*     data width. The core supports either serial architecture for minimal     *
*     area implementations, or parallel architecture for speed                 *
*     optimization. The core is delivered through the Xilinx CORE Generator    *
*     System and integrates seamlessly with the Xilinx design flow.            *
